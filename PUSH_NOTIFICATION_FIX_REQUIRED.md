# üö® Push Notification Fix Required

## **Why You're Not Receiving Notifications**

The logs show: `‚ùå Failed to get push token` and `expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53.`

**Root Cause**: You're using **Expo Go**, but push notifications require a **development build** for Expo SDK 53+.

## üîß **Solution: Create a Development Build**

### **Option 1: Quick EAS Development Build (Recommended)**

1. **Install EAS CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Expo**:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. **Build development version**:
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   # OR for Android:
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```

4. **Install the development build** on your device when complete

### **Option 2: Local Development Build**

1. **Install development build tools**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-dev-client
   ```

2. **Run development build**:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios --device
   # OR for Android:
   npx expo run:android --device
   ```

## üì± **Testing Push Notifications**

Once you have a development build:

1. **Add the test component** to any screen:
   ```tsx
   import { PushNotificationTestScreen } from '@/components/notifications/PushNotificationTestScreen';
   
   // Add to your app
   <PushNotificationTestScreen />
   ```

2. **Run the diagnostic** to verify everything works

3. **Test job notifications** using the test functions we created

## ‚ö° **Immediate Workaround: Local Notifications Only**

If you need to test now without a development build, you can test **local notifications**:

```tsx
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

// This works in Expo Go
const testLocal = async () => {
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: "üìã New Job Assignment",
      body: "Pool Cleaning - Unit 4A",
    },
    trigger: null, // Immediate
  });
};
```

## üîç **Verification Steps**

1. ‚úÖ **Development Build**: No more "Expo Go" warnings
2. ‚úÖ **Push Token**: Should get `ExponentPushToken[...]` 
3. ‚úÖ **Background Notifications**: Should work when app is closed
4. ‚úÖ **Job Assignments**: Should trigger real push notifications

## üìã **What to Expect After Fix**

- ‚úÖ Staff will receive job notifications when app is closed
- ‚úÖ Notifications will appear on lock screen
- ‚úÖ Sound/vibration alerts
- ‚úÖ Tap to open app and view job details

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Create development build** using Option 1 or 2 above
2. **Install** the development build on your test device
3. **Run diagnostic** using the test component
4. **Verify** push notifications work
5. **Test** job assignment flow end-to-end

**The push notification system is fully implemented and ready - it just needs a development build to work properly!**
