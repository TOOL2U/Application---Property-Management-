---

## ✅ **Preserved (Background Audit System)**
- ✅ `services/staffAuditService.ts` - Weekly staff performance auditing
- ✅ `services/backgroundAuditManager.ts` - Automated audit scheduling
- ✅ Firestore writes to `ai_audits/{staffId}/...`
- ✅ All background audit generation logic
- ✅ OpenAI integration for audit content only

---

## 📱 **Staff App State**
**UI Cleanup:**
- ✅ No AI tabs or navigation
- ✅ No AI assistants or chat interfaces
- ✅ No AI-related buttons on job screens
- ✅ No AI help or suggestion prompts
- ✅ Clean, focused interface without AI distractions

**Background Intelligence:**
- ✅ AI audit system runs weekly in background
- ✅ Performance data collected silently
- ✅ Reports stored in Firestore: `ai_audits/{staffId}/report_{date}.json`
- ✅ Zero UI impact or staff interaction required

---

## 🎯 **Result**
- **Staff Experience**: Clean, distraction-free mobile app focused on core job tasks
- **Admin Intelligence**: Background AI auditing continues to function automatically
- **Zero AI Visibility**: No staff-facing AI features or UI elements remain
- **Background Only**: AI audit system operates invisibly as intended

## ✅ **Final Verification**
- ✅ **Tab Navigation**: Only 5 core tabs (home, jobs, profile, settings, notifications) - no AI tabs
- ✅ **Component Imports**: No active imports of FieldOpsAssistant, useFieldOpsAI, or FOA components in app files
- ✅ **Translation Keys**: All AI-related translation keys removed from locales
- ✅ **Job Components**: AI logging and assistant references removed from job workflows
- ✅ **Staff Role Access**: No role-based AI conditionals remaining - AI completely invisible to all staff

The mobile app now has **zero AI UI components** while maintaining full background audit functionality for administrative insights.
