# Push Notification Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "No applicationId found" Error
**Problem**: Expo was trying to get push tokens on web platform without proper configuration
**Solution**: Added platform guards to skip push token requests on web

### 2. "Error getting web push token" 
**Problem**: Web platform was attempting to get Expo push tokens which aren't supported
**Solution**: Skip Expo token generation for web, use service worker notifications instead

### 3. Crashes during development
**Problem**: Push notification code was running on all platforms without proper guards
**Solution**: Added comprehensive platform detection and error handling

## Files Modified

### 1. `services/pushNotificationService.ts`
- Added platform guards for iOS/Android only
- Skip Expo push token for web platform
- Enhanced error handling for token generation
- Proper project ID validation

```typescript
// Skip push notifications for non-mobile platforms during development
if (Platform.OS !== 'ios' && Platform.OS !== 'android') {
  console.log('⚠️ Push notifications not supported on platform:', Platform.OS);
  return false;
}
```

### 2. `hooks/useNotifications.ts`
- Added Platform import
- Skip push token registration for web
- Enhanced error handling for permissions and tokens
- Fallback to demo tokens when project ID missing

```typescript
// Skip push notifications for web platform during development
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  console.log('⚠️ Skipping push token registration for web platform');
  return null;
}
```

### 3. `contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`
- Added Platform import
- Skip push permissions for web platform
- Platform-specific permission handling

```typescript
// Skip push permissions for web platform during development
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  console.log('⚠️ Skipping push permissions for web platform');
  return false;
}
```

## Platform Behavior

### Web Platform
- ✅ No push token requests
- ✅ No "applicationId" errors
- ✅ Service worker notifications still work
- ✅ No crashes or unhandled errors

### Mobile Platforms (iOS/Android)
- ✅ Push tokens work normally
- ✅ Proper permission handling
- ✅ Error handling for failed requests
- ✅ Fallback behavior when tokens fail

### Other Platforms
- ✅ Gracefully skip push notifications
- ✅ No crashes or errors
- ✅ Proper logging of unsupported platforms

## Testing

Created `app/test-notifications-fixed.tsx` to verify:
- Platform detection works correctly
- No errors on web platform
- Push service initializes properly
- Hook behavior is correct for each platform

## Key Improvements

1. **Platform Guards**: Prevent push notification code from running on unsupported platforms
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work even if push notifications fail
4. **Development-Friendly**: No crashes during development on web platform
5. **Proper Logging**: Clear console messages about what's happening on each platform

## Usage

The push notification system now:
- Automatically detects platform and adjusts behavior
- Skips problematic operations on web during development
- Provides clear feedback about what's happening
- Doesn't crash the app if push notifications fail
- Maintains full functionality on mobile platforms

## Future Considerations

For production web push notifications:
1. Configure proper web push credentials
2. Set up service worker properly
3. Add web-specific push notification handling
4. Consider using Firebase Cloud Messaging for web

The current implementation prioritizes stability during development while maintaining full mobile functionality.
